# exploratory_gene_expression_analysis
Exploratory Gene Expression Analysis Using Python
Overview

This project demonstrates my foundational skills in computational biology through exploratory analysis and visualization of gene expression data using Python. The notebook reflects my interest in integrating biological questions with data-driven approaches and serves as an initial step toward more advanced computational analyses pursued at the PhD level.

Biological Context

Gene expression analysis is a central component of modern molecular biology and biomedical research. Comparing expression levels across experimental conditions, such as control and treatment groups, provides insights into gene regulation, cellular responses, and underlying biological mechanisms.

In this project, gene expression values are analyzed across three experimental conditions:

Control

Treatment A

Treatment B

Computational Approach

The analysis was conducted in a Jupyter Notebook environment using standard tools commonly employed in computational biology labs:

pandas for organizing and manipulating biological datasets

matplotlib for generating publication-style exploratory visualizations

The focus of this notebook is exploratory data analysis (EDA), which is a critical first step in understanding biological datasets before applying statistical modeling or machine learning methods.

Analysis and Visualizations

Several complementary visualization techniques are implemented to explore the data from different perspectives:

Scatter plots to examine relationships between control and treatment conditions

Line plots to visualize expression patterns across conditions for individual genes

Box plots to compare expression distributions and variability between experimental groups

Histograms to assess the distribution of expression levels within a specific treatment

Together, these plots provide an intuitive understanding of trends, variability, and potential differences in gene expression across conditions.

Reproducibility and Structure

The analysis is fully reproducible and contained within a single Jupyter Notebook:

All code is written clearly and sequentially to reflect standard workflows used in computational biology research.

Skills Demonstrated

Through this project, I demonstrate the ability to:

Translate biological questions into computational analyses

Work with structured biological data using Python

Perform exploratory analysis of gene expression datasets

Communicate results through clear and interpretable visualizations

Academic Motivation

This project represents an early but deliberate step toward advanced training in computational biology. During my PhD, I aim to further develop these skills by applying statistical modeling, integrative multi-omics analysis, and machine learning approaches to complex biological systems.
